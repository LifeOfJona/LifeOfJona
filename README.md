### Hi, I'm Jona.👨🏽‍💻

Currently in my last year of studies **@WilfridLaurierUniversity** for **Computer Science**. I enjoy working on mini-projects on my spare time and generally dedicate majority of my time into Studying and Working out. 

To-do:
 - Fix @LifeOfJona.ca
 - Do more Leetcode.
 - Work on more projects.
